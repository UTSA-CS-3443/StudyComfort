# StudyComfort

**Study Comfort** is an Android mobile application developed for the CS-3443 Applications Programming course at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). The application is designed to help UTSA students locate and reserve study rooms that best meet their individual preferences and needs across campus.

### Overview

Finding an ideal study environment can significantly enhance productivity and comfort. Study Comfort simplifies this process by allowing users to search for study spaces across both the **Main Campus** and **Downtown Campus** using customizable filters. Whether a student prefers a quiet atmosphere, needs a specific seating capacity, or values cleanliness, Study Comfort enables informed decision-making through both objective data and peer feedback.
